        Transborder transfer of personal data in the territory of foreign
        countries that do not meet the above requirements may be carried out
        only if the personal data subject consents in writing to the transborder
        transfer of his personal data and/or fulfillment of the contract to
        which the personal data subject is a party.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title is-4">
